# Credit_Risk_Modelling

Build a machine learning model which can predict whether a borrower default or not. this model can be helpful to lenders to create score card and approve/reject loan application based on the result of the prediction.

Preprocessing Technique : 
This dataset is preprocessed using Fine Classing and Course Classing. The Course Classing done by calculating Weight of Evidence and Information Value. Weight of Evidence tells the predictive power of an independent variable in relation to the dependent variable while Information value is one of the most useful technique to select important variables in a predictive model. It helps to rank variables on the basis of their importance.

Models: 
The model used in this notebook is Logistic Regression.
